# glitch-minimal

[Brian's](https://glitch.com/@briangershon) favorite minimal setup when starting a new [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) project.

Includes:

* Express app with one view
* Styling with default fonts that look nice across operating systems
* Prettier config
* ISC license
* config for nvm (`.nvmrc` is locked to Node.js v12.0.0 since that's the most recent version on Glitch)

## How to create a new project on Glitch

You have two options.

1. Visit the <https://glitch.com/~glitch-minimal> project and **Remix It**!

2. Create a new project by choosing "New Project" then pick "Clone from Git Repo". Type in `https://github.com/briangershon/glitch-minimal` as the Github repository.

## How to run locally

If you're running this outside of Glitch:

    npm install
    npm start
