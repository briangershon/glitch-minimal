# glitch-minimal

[Brian's](https://glitch.com/@briangershon) favorite setup when starting a new [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) project.

Includes:

* Express app with one view
* Styling with default fonts that look nice across operating systems
* Prettier config
* ISC license
* config for nvm (`.nvmrc` is locked to Node.js v12.0.0 since that's the most recent version on Glitch)
